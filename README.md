# BotSupply, Denmark - Internship

My task was to develop a solution for classifying the daily business conversations of the client.

I studied a lot of white papers and various articles related to Topic Modeling field of Natural Language Processing. 

I was able to able to create a naive solution with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on the complete data and perform further optimization by taking into account the probabilistic
nature of the task and thus implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach to extract out topics of conversation. 

I started working with yet another level of optimized method i.e LDA2Vec, which actually is a combination of LDA and Word2Vec. This model will further increase the accuracy 
over LDA because of its very good semantic understanding (due to Word2Vec).

**Note:** The files which I have uploaded above are just to depict the approach that I went ahead with. Those files do not contain any of the original data that I was provided during the internship.
